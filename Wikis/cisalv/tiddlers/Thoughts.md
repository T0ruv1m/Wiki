Notice some aspects that can improve and change them timidly, see if the proposed solution holds water before implementing them widely.

But by mixing diferent cultures the level of legibility will decrease, and future updates may become impractical.

So, the honored sugestions, when elected to the architecture, will be demanded as grammar, good practices that make us understood.

Classes are like genome, index is like epigenome. 

Current concatenational style is more intutive and requires less modules, but object orieted provides encapsulation and reuse.

by organizing files by affinity, not aritificial categories, we make reduce file traveling and gain agility. Most importantly, we make the code more cohese and less coupled.

se iremos seguir a metafora orgânica a sério, devemos pensar cada elemento como se fosse também evento, e não como coisa.

A pagina construída é o resquício gráfico da série das ultimas operações realizadas.

Ela é estática só enquanto ninguem engatilha outra metamorfose.(mas poderiamos criar eventos dançantes)

i was thinking of concatenation, but it may be much more:

step 1 make x.

step 2 modifies the previously made x.

now i got origami analogy.

instead of adding clausures to what you've made, I will transform them.

add event listener > injection "change theme"
