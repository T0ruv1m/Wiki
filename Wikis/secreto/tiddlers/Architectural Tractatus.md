So, we can define Architecture as "the decisions I wish i had took earlier".

* The plans are simply put the visible traces of those decisions.

* There are decisions in different levels of scale, that happens to be for a lot of reasons.

* The form remains potential until the minutiae of implementation reveals it.

Some architects think of themselves as overarching decision makers, responsible only for the bigger decisions, leaving the realm of details to the interior designer, or the carpenter, or the builder.

* This leads to a wrong thought: the verticalization of importance and of creativity.

* Construction is not a mechanical realization of intent but an act of further decision-making.

Although decision making flows from general to specific, buildings are constructed from the opposite direction, trough piecemeal accretions.

The amount of decisions actually needed for starting the building is minimum, since their adequacy can only be determined by retrospection.
 
That is exemplified as trackback - a chain reaction of retraction.

* If an early decision proves flawed, the subsequent ones must be unraveled.

* The goal of the architect is to discover a sequence which has the least amount of trackback.

Yet always consider that every decision harbors the potential for reversal, as even a minor alteration at a higher level may nullify many finer judgments.

What cannot be sequenced rigorously must be silenced.
Whereof one cannot build with certainty, thereof one must leave unplanned.
