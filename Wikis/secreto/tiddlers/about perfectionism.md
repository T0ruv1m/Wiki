I was a perfectionist. This is not to say that i like to do good things, but that I did not tolerate imperfect ones. This is rooted in my insecurity and my dad's fixation with the intellect.

What I've learned on the recent years was not to overcome perfectionism, but to transfer it from product to process. So, I still need to make things neat, as an architect, I'm overly concerned with details. But I'm much more critical of the way I do than of the end result. This means that I can tolerate bad products if I'm always striving for a better one. 

By noticing that my perfectionism, instead of making me create better and better, was dragging me into paralyses and mediocrity, I've started letting it go, only because I've noticed its not optimal to be that way. 

So yeah, it may be hard to work with a person like that. But for some reason I've never pushed anyone to be like me. I always knew that it was my own duty, if a wanted to deliver something good, to work for everyone else that is not as invested.

This shift from product to process also makes me receptive and non-judgemental if others participate in the same effort, even if I dislike their taste or way of doing things. Now I can live with my own imperfection and clumsiness as well. After all, I'm akin to it.

There is more to it. I think I've stopped thinking about miself so much. Like, people can make mean comments about me and it crosses over my head without disturbance. I can see people younger than me, way  above my league, and forget to feel envy for a time. This is a sign that something pre-reflective had happened, cause it is not induced, its my normal behavior.

See? I still notice the fragments, and I'm still affected in some way, but I'm *letting GO*, I think that expression carries the essential for this type of transformation.
