I realized I, sooner or later, tend to do my to-dos. They almost make law of attraction a thing to consider.

instead of making to-dos a shore, i can train my [[naming]] skills and focus on using the exact words that make the most clear goal and give me an object of attention that i can hold in working memory. It is the art of **goal magnetism**!

refactoring the objective is also viable since the process reveals and alters the real target.
