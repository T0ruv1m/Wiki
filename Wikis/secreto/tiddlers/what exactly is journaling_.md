Is a self imposed TraumaExposureTherapy.

Is DuckDebugging yourself. 

Is Injecting Feedback in short cycles so that you can realign objectives and aspirations and stop living in *auto-pilot.*

Is a New-Day Resolution!

Is remembering daily that *You must change your life.*

Is the slow diggestion of Samskaras.
